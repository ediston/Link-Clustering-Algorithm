Linked List Implementation for the Step1 (Similarity calucaltion step)
Why we doing this?
1. To check if it impacts complexity (space and time)
2. Will help in deciding hardware architecture 

Implementation Details:
1. LinkedList.h and LinkedList.cpp contains the linked list implementation
2. calcSimilarity.cpp is the dirving file
