Linked List Implementation for the Step1 (Similarity calucaltion step)
Why we doing this?
1. To check if it impacts complexity (space and time)
2. Will help in deciding hardware architecture 

Implementation Details:
1. LinkedList.h and LinkedList.cpp contains the linked list implementation
2. calcSimilarity.cpp is the dirving file

Linked List Implementation

1.First linked list node structure.
struct node{
  long long nodeid;
  node* next;
};

2.Implementation of sub steps
Step1.1
Here we will combine Step1.1 and Step1.2 of the original implementation
Method: 
  1. Read the one edge from the file, E= (n_i to n_j, n_j)
  2. Check if this nodeid has been added before, maintain a map<long long, node* > nodeids;
  3. If not added then create a new linked list head and add it to nodeids map.
  4. Else add n_i to Linkedlist of n_j and add n_j to Linkedlist of n_i
  5. All additions will be done while keeping the linked list in sorted order
Complexity: O(E*N)

Step  1.2, Covered in Step1.1

Step 1.3 One by one consider each node(n_k) as the keystone and then for each node(n_i), select another node (n_j) such that (n_i!=n_k) and (n_j!=n_k) and (n_i  < n_j).
Method: We iterate through the neighbors of n_k. For each neighbor we again iterate the neighbors of n_k.
Complexity: O(n^2)

Step 1.4 For the two given nodes(n_i, n_j) and the keystone node count the common neighbors for the two nodes
Method: as the nodeids are added in increasing order. For each node n_i we start from n_j=n_i->next 
Complexity: O(len(Adj(n_i)) + len(Adj(n_j)))

Step 1.5 Calculate the similarity measure.
Method: Letâ€™s say the count of common neighbors is Ccn. Then similarity is:
		Ccn/(Cn_i + Cn_j - Ccn)
Complexity: O(1)

Step 1.6 Write the two links and the similarity measure to the file
Method: Writing to a file is linear?
Complexity: O(1)

Overall Complexity: O(n^3)
